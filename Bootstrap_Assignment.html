<td><b>What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Ans.</td>
<td><p>Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system. Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.</p>
<p>For Example:</p>

<div class="container border border-dark">
	<h1>This Is Container in bootestrap</h1>
</div>
</td>

<tr>
<td>Que-03</td>
<td><b>What are the default Bootstrap text settings?</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ans.</td>
<td><p><b>Bootstrap 5 uses a default Text Setting Is <br>
 font-size of 1rem (16px by default), and its line-height is 1.5.<br>
In addition, all &lt;p> elements have margin-top: 0 and margin-bottom: 1rem (16px by default).<b> 
</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>Que-04</td>
	<td><b>What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ans.</td>
<td><p>Our grid supports six responsive breakpoints. Breakpoints are based on min-width media queries, meaning they affect that breakpoint and all those above it (e.g., .col-sm-4 applies to sm, md, lg, xl, and xxl). This means you can control container and column sizing and behavior by each breakpoint.
<ol>
<li>Containers center and horizontally pad your content. Use .container for a responsive pixel width, .container-fluid for width: 100% across all viewports and devices, or a responsive container (e.g., .container-md) fir combination of fluid and pixel widths.</li>

<li>Rows are wrappers for columns. Each column has horizontal padding (called a gutter) for controlling the space between them. This padding is then counteracted on the rows with negative margins to ensure the content in your columns is visually aligned down the left side. Rows also support modifier classes to uniformly apply column sizing and gutter classes to change the spacing of your content.</li>

<li>Columns are incredibly flexible. There are 12 template columns available per row, allowing you to create different combinations of elements that span any number of columns. Column classes indicate the number of template columns to span (e.g., col-4 spans four). widths are set in percentages so you always have the same relative sizing.</li>

<li>Gutters are also responsive and customizable. Gutter classes are available across all breakpoints, with all the same sizes as our margin and padding spacing. Change horizontal gutters with .gx-* classes, vertical gutters with .gy-*, or all gutters with .g-* classes. .g-0 is also available to remove gutters.</li>

<li>SCSS variables, maps, and mixins power the grid. If you don’t want to use the predefined grid classes in Bootstrap, you can use our grid’s source Sass to create your own with more semantic markup. We also include some CSS custom properties to consume these SCSS variables for even greater flexibility for you.</li>
